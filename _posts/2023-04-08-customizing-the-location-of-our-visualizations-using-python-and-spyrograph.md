## Introduction
Trochoids and cycloids are generated by tracing a point on a rolling circle as it moves around a fixed circle - these shapes have captivated artists, mathematicians, and enthusiasts for centuries with their elegant, geometric patterns

These mesmerizing patterns, often seen in spirograph designs, offer endless possibilities for exploration and creativity. One of the most powerful ways to customize and control the appearance of trochoid curves is by adjusting the origin â€“ the central point around which the entire pattern revolves

In this blog post, we will delve into the concept of customizing the origin in our designs uncovering its role in the shape's geometry and its impact on the final design. We will explore various techniques to shift and manipulate the origin, as well as demonstrate how combining multiple trochoid shapes with different origins can result in intricate and visually stunning patterns
