In the world of mathematics there is a limitless supply of patterns, visualizations, and concepts just waiting to be explored

Some of those concepts are known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids - beautiful patterns traced from a circle rolling around the inside or outside of a fixed circle

Let's dive in and explore how `spyrograph` helps us analyze and explore these simple mathematical concepts in just a few lines of code!
