In the world of mathematics there is a limitless supply of patterns, visualizations, and concepts just waiting to be explored

Some of those concepts are known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids - beautiful patterns traced from a circle rolling around the inside or outside of a fixed circle (such as this epitrochoid for example)

Let's dive in and explore how `spyrograph` helps us analyze and explore these simple mathematical concepts in just a few lines of code!

## What are hypotrochoids and epitrochoids?

Simply put, hypotrochoids and epitrochoids are curves formed by tracing a point on a circle as it rolls around the inside (for the hypotrochoid) or the outside (for the epitrochoid) of a fixed circle

The resulting curves can be incredibly intricate, elegant, and pleasing to the eye and have a surprisingly wide range of applications ranging from engineering to astronomy and even the patterns printed on banknotes, securities, and passports as a security measure against counterfeiting
