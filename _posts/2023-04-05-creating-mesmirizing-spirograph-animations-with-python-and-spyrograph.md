## Captivating spirograph animations: an overview
Spirograph animations can be both mesmerizing and captivating, providing endless hours of entertainment as well as a visual exploration of mathematical patterns. In this section, we'll provide an overview of spirograph animations and discuss how the animate method in the Spyrograph library can help us create stunning visual displays with ease

A spirograph is a geometric shape formed by tracing a point on the circumference of a circle as it rolls along the inside or outside of a fixed circle. The combination of these two circles creates a unique path, resulting in a captivating and intricate pattern. With the help of the Spyrograph library, we can create a wide variety of these patterns using just a few simple parameters

The animate method in the Spyrograph library is a powerful tool for generating and visualizing spirograph patterns. By providing a range of values for the input parameters, we can create a sequence of spirographs that smoothly transition from one to another, giving the illusion of a continuous animation. This method takes care of all the drawing and updating, allowing us to focus on the creative aspect of designing our spirograph animations.

Let's look at a simple example of how to use the animate method to create a spirograph animation:

{% highlight python %}
from spyrograph import Hypotrochoid
import numpy as np

Hypotrochoid.animate(
    R=307,
    r=np.arange(57, 75, .05),
    d=33,
    thetas=np.arange(0,100, .1),
    frame_pause=.02
)
{% endhighlight %}

</p>

In this example, we call the animate method on the Hypotrochoid class with our chosen parameter values. This will generate a sequence of spirograph animations, each with a different radius r while keeping the other parameters constant.

The animate method is highly versatile, allowing us to customize the appearance of our animations by adjusting various parameters such as the color, width, and screen size. This flexibility enables us to create a wide range of visually appealing spirograph animations that cater to our artistic preferences

In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into the animate method, exploring its various customization options and providing tips and tricks to help us master the art of spirograph animation

## Customizing our spirograph animations
One of the most exciting aspects of using the animate method is the ability to customize and personalize our spirograph animations. With a plethora of configuration options at our fingertips, we can create unique patterns that resonate with our artistic vision. In this section, we'll explore some of the ways you can customize our animations using the animate method

### Varying the circle radii and tracing point distance
The primary driving factors behind the generated patterns are the radii of the fixed and rolling circles (R and r, respectively) and the distance of the tracing point from the rolling circle (d). By altering these parameters, we can create a wide array of stunning spirograph designs. For example, we can experiment with different combinations of R, r, and d to find the perfect balance that produces intricate and mesmerizing patterns

**Varying the radius of the fixed circle:**
{% highlight python %}
Hypotrochoid.animate(
    R=np.arange(201*3, 215*3, .1*3),
    r=179*3,
    d=79*3,
    thetas=np.arange(0,50, .1),
    frame_pause=.08
)
{% endhighlight %}

</p>

**Varying the radius of the rolling circle:**
{% highlight python %}
Hypotrochoid.animate(
    R=307,
    r=np.arange(57, 60, .025),
    d=33,
    thetas=np.arange(0,100, .1),
    frame_pause=.08
)
{% endhighlight %}

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/animation_circle_rolling_circle_modify.gif" alt="An animation of lines rotating creating beautiful geometric patterns">
</p>

**Varying the distance from the rolling circle:**
{% highlight python %}
Hypotrochoid.animate(
    R=300,
    r=113,
    d=np.arange(113, 140, .5),
    thetas=np.arange(0,50, .1),
    frame_pause=.08
)
{% endhighlight %}

</p>

### Color and line width customization
The animate method also allows us to customize the color and width of the traced lines. By changing the color and width parameters, we can achieve different visual effects and styles. Whether we want a subtle, delicate design or a bold, striking pattern, adjusting these parameters gives us the creative freedom to bring our vision to life

### Control over theta tange and step
Another powerful customization option is the ability to define the range of theta values and the incremental step between them. By modifying either the thetas argument or the theta_start, theta_stop, and theta_step parameters, we can control the precision and smoothness of the traced lines. Smaller theta steps lead to smoother curves, while larger steps create more segmented patterns, offering yet another avenue for personalizations

### Background and screen customization
The animate method enables us to customize the background color and screen size of your animations through the screen_color and screen_size parameters. By adjusting these settings, we can create a visual environment that complements our spirograph design and enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of our animations

In summary, the animate method in the Spyrograph library provides a wealth of customization options for us to explore. By playing with different configurations and settings, we can create captivating spirograph animations that are uniquely yours. So, let's unleash our creativity and dive into the world of personalized spirograph animations using the powerful animate method
