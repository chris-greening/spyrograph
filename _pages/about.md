## The philosophy

{% highlight python %}
import this
{% endhighlight %}

`spyrograph` was designed with [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) at its heart. Every design choice is carefully considered to make drawing and analyzing beautiful geometries as smooth as possible. The syntax is expressive and concise, allowing for beautiful and explicit code that is clean and immediately obvious. There should never be a moment where you're questioning why the API does what it does; it is fluid and intuitive, designed for you the developer.
