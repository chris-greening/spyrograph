## :computer: Installation <a name="installation"></a>

### pip
Install the latest stable release from PyPI using
```shell
$ pip3 install spyrograph
```

or clone the development version from GitHub with
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/chris-greening/spyrograph.git
```

## :seedling: Quickstart <a name="quickstart"></a>

`spyrograph` is designed to be expressive and easy-to-use - simply `import spyrograph` and jump right into drawing elegant, complex shapes in just a few lines of code!

```python
from spyrograph import Hypotrochoid

# Trace a hypotrochoid from 0 to 2pi where
# the fixed circle radius is 300, rolling circle 
# radius is 200, and the distance from the rolling 
# circle is 100
hypotrochoid = Hypotrochoid(
    R=300,
    r=200,
    d=100,
    thetas=np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, .1)
)
hypotrochoid.trace(
    show_circles=True, 
    frame_pause=.05, 
    circle_color="grey"
)
```
